# Contributing Guidelines

Before adding anything to the project, make sure to follow the following steps

## 1. Check Out a New Branch

Whenever you are working on a new feature, make sure to checkout a new branch.
(where `$username` is your own username on github).

```bash
git checkout -b $username
```

Naming convention for branches are as follows. Use a prefix that fits the kind
of change the branch is making.

|Type of Branch|Name Format|
|--------------|-----------|
| feature|`feature/$name`|
| hotfix|`hotfix/$name`|
| documentation|`doc/$name`|

## 2. Document Your Code

Whenever you are adding new features or changing the code, make sure to add
documentation. Use the
[C# XML Documentation Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k--kato.docomment)
for documentation. This uses XML Documentation for C#. If you have any questions
about this code, reference the
[doxygen manual](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/xmlcmds.html).

## 3. Make a Pull Request

You cannot push directly to `main`, you must make a pull request, have it
reviewed by other contributors, then commit it to the repository. Only make
a PR when the feature is ready to be added or is a significant change in
a development feature.

Also, you must ensure you code is up to date. To do this rebase with `main`
(keep commit logs easy to understand). Do this by executing the
following commands.

```bash
# Assuming working on some feature branch named $feature_name

# Go to feature branch
git checkout $feature_name
# Fetch up to date main
git fetch origin main
# Rebase current branch with main
git rebase origin/main
```

See [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
guide from github for any more questions about how to make pull requests.

As far as coding style, please try to stay consistent with
[Csharp Coding Guidelines](https://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Csharp_Coding_Guidelines)
from Unity's reference guide.

## 4. Style Check

In order to finish your PR, ensure you code follows the style guidelines of the
project. The rules for our style are defined in the `.editorconfig`
file and there is a pre-commit hook that will execute whenever you make a
commit to the repository. In addition there is a github actions workflow that
will verify the style of all changed files.

```PowerShell
dotnet tool restore
dotnet format --fix-style warn -v d .\OpenKCC.sln --check
```

## 5. Done

If you follow all these steps, we should have a clean, working `main` branch.
