# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## In Progress

* Updated kcc state machine to be synced with the network kcc.
* Removed ParentConstraint requirement from the KCCStateMachine
    and replaced with a new `RelativeParentConfig` object to managed
    player's relative position to a parent object.
* Reorganized camera controller code to be more reusable between the main
    and netcode projects.
* Moved camera control code to the `nickmaltbie.OpenKCC.CameraControls`
    namespace within the openkcc project.
* Added example using unity Netcode and sub package com.nickmaltbie.openkcc.netcode
* Reformatted some code in the KCCStateMachine to reduce the amount of copied
    code between netcode character controller and basic character controller.
* Modified github actions workflows to deploy netcode example to the site
    under the directory Netcode.
* Depreciated old fields for objects that were duplicated in
    the netcode version of the openkcc.
    Whenever possible, I will include an auto-translation to the new format
    to avoid having to save and manually copy values between version upgrades.
    * Depreciated the old fields for KCCStateMachine and replaced with the
        object HumanoidKCCConfig. Also added some code to auto-convert the old
        fields into a HumanoidKCCConfig when the object is first de-serialized.
        Tagged this version with a string property and called this first version
        v1.0.0 and will use a semantic versioning system to update the value.
    * Depreciated the old fields for CameraController and replaced with the
        object CameraConfig. Also added some code to auto-convert th e old
        fields into a CameraConfig when the object is first de-serialized.
        Tagged this version with a string property and called this first version
        v1.0.0 and will use a semantic versioning system to update the value.

Major Refactor

* Moved simplified demo examples to demo sample folder
    * Also fixed dependency issues so each sample can be imported independently
* Setup package build workflow to copy `Assets/Samples` to
    `./Packages/com.nickmaltbie.openkcc/Samples~` and validating github workflow
    to ensure this works as expected.
* Created a common folder for assets shared between mulitple samples
    `./Packages/com.nickmaltbie.openkcc/Common` - will keep small files
    and assets here that are shared (but avoid large models and textures).
* Emptied all assets from `Assets\OpenKCC` to avoid complexity.

Minor Fixes
