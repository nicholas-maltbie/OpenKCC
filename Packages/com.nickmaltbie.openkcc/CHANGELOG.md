## In Progress

Major Refactor
* Converting project to follow unity package layout
* Moved example FPS cahracter into example first person cahracter sample folder
* Moved simplified demo examples to demo sample folder
* Renamed `Samples` folder to `Samples~` and replaced the `Samples~` folder
    in the export with a directory junction symbolic link. 
    Oh my gosh, I didn't expect this to work but it did, symbolic links are
    magical and I love them.
