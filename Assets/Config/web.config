 The following server configuration can be used for uncompressed WebGL builds.

 This configuration has been tested with Unity 2020.1 builds, hosted on IIS 7.5, IIS 8.5, and IIS 10.0.

     IIS does not provide default handlers for .data and .wasm files (and in some cases .json files),
     therefore these files wonâ€™t be served unless their mimeType is explicitly specified.

       NOTE: IIS will throw an exception if a mimeType is specified multiple times for the same extension.
       To avoid possible conflicts with configurations that are already on the server, you should remove the mimeType for the corresponding extension using the <remove> element,
       before adding mimeType using the <mimeMap> element.
