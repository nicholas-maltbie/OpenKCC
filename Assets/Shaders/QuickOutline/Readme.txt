Quick Outline
=============

Developed by Chris Nolet (c) 2018


Instructions
------------

To add an outline to an object, drag-and-drop the Outline.cs script onto the
object. The outline materials will be loaded at runtime.

You can also add outlines programmatically with:

    var outline = gameObject.AddComponent<Outline>();

    outline.OutlineMode = Outline.Mode.OutlineAll;
    outline.OutlineColor = Color.yellow;
    outline.OutlineWidth = 5f;

The outline script does a small amount of work in Awake(). For best results,
use outline.enabled to toggle the outline. Avoid removing and re-adding the
component if possible.

For large meshes, you may also like to enable 'Precompute Outline' in the
editor. This will reduce the amount of work performed in Awake().
